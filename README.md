Dog Adoption
While searching through multiple pet adoption websites I've noticed most pages are extremely minimalist and often don't work well. My hope is to create a page that is easy to navigate, looks pleasant, and is easily (inter-)changeable.

Issues
The biggest issue I've run into is the lack of APIs that work or don't need an extensive approval to use; therefore

Approach
created a wire frame (handdrawn)

created a react app

worked with functional components

imported router for a more user friendly experience

used multiple components of which some will need state/ props rendering

still have not been able to use an API as none of them actually worked

Future Notes
I'd really like to come back to this to actually implement everything I've had in mind which isn't possible due to various reasons at the moment. Things I'd like to achieve in the future:

add API (or similar!?) of list of adoptable dogs

be able to have them added to a "cart"

apply for a visit/ adoption by filling out a form

fix the page layout; sidebar is making it difficult to have things render in the middle of the page

add pictures either from API or regular (unsure how to do it)

add redux at the end of the finished project
