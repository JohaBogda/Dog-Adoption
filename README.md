Dog Adoption
While searching through multiple pet adoption websites I've noticed most pages are extremely minimalist and often don't work well. My hope is to create a page that is easy to navigate, looks pleasant, and is easily (inter-)changeable.

Issues
The biggest issue I've run into is the lack of APIs that work or don't need an extensive approval to use; therefore the only API I'm using is to search for Breeds to get an idea for dogs; I originally would have liked to use a drop down menu (https://www.carlrippon.com/drop-down-data-binding-with-react-hooks/)

Approach
created a wire frame (handdrawn)

created a react app

worked with functional components

imported router for a more user friendly experience

used multiple components of which some will need state/ props rendering

Future Notes
I'd really like to come back to this to actually implement everything I've had in mind which isn't possible due to various reasons at the moment. Things I'd like to achieve in the future:

add API (or similar!?) of list of adoptable dogs
put together more pages for more information: calendar, donation, adoption process etc
